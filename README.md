Install:

```bash
$ rpm -i hangouts-chat-1.0.1.x86_64.rpm
```
### Other distributions

There is an AppImage available on the [Releases](https://github.com/craicoverflow/hangouts-chat-desktop/releases) page. This should work for most other distributions of Linux.

Once downloaded you will need to make the file executable:
